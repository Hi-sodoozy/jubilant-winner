                <p>Iain Duguid has been writing radio and podcast commercials for close to 20 years and has made a name for himself as a trustworthy and effective writer in this space, having written commercials for Australia's biggest companies, including Jetstar, Ford Au, Myer, Beyond Blue, and various SMEs across Melbourne and regional Australia.</p>
                <p>Simply tell Iain what you'd like to advertise and he'll write a script for you.</p>

                <p>You never have to make a decision on making an ad again. Simply mention your budget and it'll happen. Iain works closely with various voiceover artists and agencies, and audio producers to create commercials that you'll be proud to share.</p>
                <p>We have recently seen broadcast publishers ink deals which can see you pay a premium, but receive a sub-par result. Iain Duguid is not bound by any commercial agreements. If you've had a bad experience or been told that something can't happen, and you suspect something suspicious, chat with Iain and we'll sort something out.</p>
                <p class="commercial-note"><em>Please note: It is unlikely that Iain will be able to produce commercials written by an in-house creative team from a legal point of view, as a radio station or agency will often retain IP of the commercial.</em></p>

                <p>Iain has developed relationships with top-tier audio producers who will make your commercial. There are a number of production houses in a race to the bottom and everyone &mdash; especially you, the client &mdash; loses. Iain isn't playing that game. The only thing that matters is that you connect to your customers in the best possible way.</p>
